# CODTECH-Task2-Webapp-Pentest
Developed a custom web app to explore and understand webapp penetration testing through self-coded examples for exploiting vulnerabilities via various webapp features like: 

➨ Brute forcing, no rate limiting : During registration

➨ SQLi: During Login

➨JSi: Search bar 

➨CSRF: Feedback form

➨CORS: API service

➨Unrestricted File upload: DFMS
